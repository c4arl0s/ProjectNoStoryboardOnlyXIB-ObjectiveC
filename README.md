# How does it look AppDelegate.m ?

## looks the pointer firstViewController

1. Delete the storyBoard.
2. Delete The main Interface, it is where you normally call your storyboard, Delete what it is inside.
3. Allocate an UIWindow in memory, then send the message initWithFrame.
4. Allocate FirstViewControllerClass in memory and send the message init, then asign it to a firstViewController pointer
5. Asign firstViewController to a rootViewController.
6. send the message makeKeyAndVisible to the self.window.
